- 👋 Hi, I’m @REShelton

- 👮🏼‍♂️ I am a full time law enformcent officer and I have been since 2015. Currenlty, I am ssigned to the Major Case unit within the Criminal Investigations Division. in this unit, I investigate crimes ranging from Robbery to Murder. 

- 📚 In 2022, I re-enrolled into my local community college to pursue a degree in Software & Web Development. I have become interested in this after I attempted to develop a GTA:V FiveM server. I have since been self-teaching. I have enjoyed programming enough to re-enroll into school and possibly look at software development as a back-up plan to law enformcent or a possible career change.
